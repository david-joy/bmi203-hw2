    # Frey, B.J., and Dueck, D. (2007). Clustering by passing messages between
    # data points. Science 315, 972â€“976.
    # http://www.psi.toronto.edu/affinitypropagation/FreyDueckScience07.pdf

    # Affinity propagation assigns clusters by attempting to identify
    # exemplars within the data that represent a large number of data points.
    # Each point is assigned "responsibility" for it's neighbors in proprotion
    # to how representative it is, then each point is assigned "availability"
    # based on how near to a cluster border it is. After several iterations,
    # the availability of a point decreases and it can be assigned to a single
    # cluster.

    # This is a naive implementation based on the author's MATLAB sample code
    # with O(N**3) runtime. An improved implementation would reuse operations
    # and have O(N**2) behavior on a dense similarity matrix and O(N) on a
    # sparse similarity matrix.

    # The key advantage of affinity propagation is that it does not require
    # selection of a cluster size, only a damping term that determines how
    # quickly messages decay.
